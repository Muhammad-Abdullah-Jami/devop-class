# devop-class
what i  learend in devops class
The most important thing that i learned in class was that how i have to link myself to opensource projects and add my contribution in it.
How i have to add value to certain open source projects and how i have to find a place to fit in there. I learned about kubernetes and docker and most important thing i learned about Sigstore-Cosign and Fulcio though the blogs i have written.
